# Supernovas-and-the-accelerated-espansion-of-the-universe

Proposed cosmology project in which the accelerated expansion of our universe will be shown. More information can be found in 'Enunciado Supernovas.pdf'.

Place the files in folder 'Data' with the main program and run it. You will get an extra data file ('datos.dat'), which is also located in 'Data' from 'https://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/figures/SCPUnion2.1_mu_vs_z.txt' and ffive plots. The first one ('r frente a z - sin modelos.pdf') will show the distance modulus (μ) as a function of redshift (z) with the data from Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt	and	Adam G. Reiss' articles ('https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf'). This data is stored in files 'datos1.dat' y 'datos2.dat'. The second plot ('r frente a z.pdf') will contain the same data as well as the expected values for two different models, Einstein-de Sitter and ΛCDM concordance. The third plot ('r frente a z extra datos.pdf') will add more information, adding more meassures from the information that we have stored in 'datos.dat'. The fourth plot ('r frente a z extra modelos.pdf') will add more information, adding another model. Finally, tha last plot ('r frente a z ajuste.pdf') will show the best fit for the experimentaal data.

The file 'Supernovas y la expansión acelerada del universo - Iván Villegas.pdf' contains all the information (in Spanish), including equations and conclusions.
